2 Python scrips provided, the first (NMPURLCreator.py) parses a flat list of geocodes from a provided text file (copied from geographies.csv) and converts them into NMP URL's.

 1. Download scripts NMPURLCreator.py and NMPClassAPI.py
 2. Install Python 3.X and Pandas libaries, i use https://anaconda.org/    
 3. Create the list of geocodes in a txt file prior, and place in the same directory as the script e.g (NOAM-US-WA-SEA)
 4. Execute the script from $ NMPURLCreator.py [geocode file location] 
   - 3 flat files containing the URLs are created in the same directory from where the script was run, with up to 5K URL's per file.  NMP usually requires re-authentication (new cookies) after 5K URL's, currently there are 11.5K geocodes in geographies (Dec 2018)
 6. Source .AspNet and CSRF cookies from a browser (load NMP in the browser and copy cookies from F12 /Storage/ Cookies)
 7. Run the NMPClassAPI.py [file location and name] script to query NMP using a list of URL's.  It will prompt for the cookies when run
 8. It can 1-2hrs to fetch the JSON response from the 5K URL's, once complete a geocodes.xlsx is created
 9. Rename the xlsx otherwise it will be overwritten, get new cookies, and run the script again against remaining geocode urls
